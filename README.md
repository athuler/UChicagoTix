# UChicago Ticketing System

This is an ***unofficial*** site built on top of
[UChicago's ticketing infrastructure](https://tickets.uchicago.edu "UChicago Tickets").
The main differences between the systems are:

* Allow users to view the number of remaining tickets
* Easier linking (ie. `/falsettos`
instead of `/Online/default.asp?doWork::WScontent::loadArticle=Load&BOparam::WScontent::
loadArticle::article_id=80CABB0D-1081-4DC3-BDEC-FFBD195F45E1`
* (An attempt at) A Better User Experience

Below are instructions on how you can get the most out of this project.
